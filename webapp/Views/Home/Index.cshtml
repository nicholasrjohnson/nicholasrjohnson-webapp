          Prayer
        </h2>
        <p class="blurb p-1">
          My wife and I have a small ministry. God has set us free from so much along with blessing us 
          abundantly. We would like to give back to the community and people in need. If you feel like 
          you are struggling, we would love to help, whether it be through encouraging you, praying 
          for you, or connecting you to resources. We go to a great church called Allison Park Church 
          in Hampton Township, Pittsburgh.

        Computers
      </h2>
      <p class="blurb p-1">
        I love computers. Ever since I was young, I have been involved with computing in different ways. 
        My father had a technology lab back in the 80s at his middle school where he taught. As soon as he 
        could, he brought me there, and I fell in love. Consequently, I went RIT for my undergrad in 2000 and 
        was an active member of Computer Science House.

        Music
      </h2>
      <p class="blurb p-1">
        I started producing music in 2000 and DJed for a little while. I took a hiatis for some years and 
        then got back into it before I moved to Pittsburgh. I have retired for awhile and will pick it up later
        in life.. I worked with Ableton Live for some time after a long stint with FLStudio making unique electronic 
        tracks. Some of my favorite plugins are Valhalla Room Reverb and the Serum Synthesizer.
