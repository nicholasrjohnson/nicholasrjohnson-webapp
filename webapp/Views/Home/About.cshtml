          <h6 class="text-left">
            I was born in Grand Rapids, MI, and I moved around a few times. I fell in love with computers in 
            the 80s when my dad had a computer lab in his middle school. He brought me there and let me experiment, and I was 
            hooked. This is truly when I started my career. I later went to Rochester Institute of Technology for some undergrad 
            and finished my schooling at Indiana University of Pennsylvania. Many great memories have been made.<

          <h2>Pittsburgh</h2>
          <h6 class="text-left">
            I moved to Pittsburgh in 2018 where I met my beautiful wife, Casey. I have been having a blast 
            ever since I came here. She, myself, and my stepson, Jayce, are a motley crew that enjoy doing a number of thing 
            around the city. Pittsburgh is like a small town and a metropolis at the same time, not to mention it is a serious 
            tech hub.

        <p class="blurb p-1">
          I love all things aquatic, from plants to fishes to snails. I had six aquariums at one time, but 
          now I only have three, a 20 gallon, a 30 gallon, and a 5 gallon. I have various different fish from
          Gold Laser Corydors, to Panda Angelfish, to Kuhli Loaches, and even Bleeding Heart Tetras.
          Below is a link to a forum I was involved with that taught me so much about the hobby.

        <h2 class="blurbtitle">CSH</h2>
        <p class="blurb">
          During my time at RIT, I was a member of Computer Science House, and I still try to stay active. 
          It is still going strong throughout the years. I was freshman year class president in 2000 and participated 
          in projects while I was there. I had ideas for a couple cutting edge projects and benefited the floor with 
          my wood working experience. It was a lot of fun!

        <h2 class="blurbtitle">Fortnite</h2>
        <p class="blurb">
          I enjoy playing Fortnite with my stepson, Jayce. He always beats me, but we have a great 
          time. I watch him get Victory Royale after Victory Royale. He truly is on his way to becoming a video 
          game expert, his dream job. He also play many other game like Mario Rabbids, Super Smash Brothers Ultimate,
          Donkey Kong Tropical Freeze, and Rocket League. I am always trying to get him involved with other games.
          I am more interested in making software instead of playing games, however, I can live vicariously through him.
