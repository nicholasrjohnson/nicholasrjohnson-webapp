    I work on various projects from using Java to C#. My main focus lately has been .NET Framework 4 Applications and DotNetCore 
    web applications. As I have done things in the private and government sector before, I am now developing my own 
    portfolio. I have many ideas I would like to share, and I'm filling my GitHub repositories with code.

        <p class="blurb">I started developing this rideshare for a friend with a more specific purpose in mind. At the time, 
          it was hard for me to find the time to work on it. Now, without my friend, I have decided to make the project my own 
          and make the rideshare for everyone it general. It uses Dotnet Core 5.0</p>

        <p class="blurb">
          I am working on a commenting system for blog apps like Ghost with a friend of mine, Joe Esposito. 
          It currently uses Django and will be hosted on Heroku. It will allow people to put a tag in their sites 
          that will allow them to have a commenting system with whatever format they want, even emulating major 
          sites like Reddit or Slashdot.

        <p class="blurb">In addition, one of my projects has been developed as a testing ground for ideas with Signal R at work. It alters a Bar Graph in realtime using alteration in a SQL Server table.</p>
